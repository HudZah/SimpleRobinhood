# Robinhood App

This is a simple Robinhood-like web app that allows the user to view up-to-date information on a list of tickers. The app consists of a React Hooks-based frontend and a Node.js backend that handles API requests and emulates the basic functionality of the NASDAQ API by returning lists of ticker prices.

## Instructions to build and run

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/HudZah/SimpleRobinhood.git
```
2. Install the dependencies:
```
npm install
```
3. Start the Node server:
```
npm start
```
4. Lastly, change directory to the client, then start the React server
```
cd client
npm start
```
The app will be available at http://localhost:3000.
